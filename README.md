Brief Project Description:This program uses Kivy to display the reading list to the user through the GUI.
The user can change the required book to completion and add a new book.
Through the program, you can check the required book, completed book and check the number of pages.
When you add a new book, you need to enter a title, artist, and page.
These added books are automatically saved in the CSV file at the end of the program.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

    It took almost 24 hours. For 24 hours, I focused on this project without doing anything else even I did not sleep.
    I spent most of my time looking for the code that I did during my previous practice sessions and finding a solution on Google.
    Also, I tried to be as careful as possible for making function name, because the function name was pointed out last time.


## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

    Programming Fundamentals Tasks and Task 1 in Programming 1, there was a lot of duplication of code.
    I did not consider the future when I designed codes first,
    so I had a lot of situations that I had to modify my code if I did not want to rewrite similar code later.
    It took a lot of time to modify my first code, and I could not modify everything.
    But in this assignment, I was satisfied that I could write to avoid duplicate code.


## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

    When creating function names (as noted above, because I was pointed out in the past assignment)
    I tried to be a lot careful, but the many of  first function names I made had been changed when I started to make main.py.
    I found a lot of inexperienced function names when creating main.py.
    After trying to change the function name one by one, after the finished the coding,
    the error caused by the inconsistency of the function name was continuously caught in the test process.
    It took a lot of time to make corrections and check everything.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

    In general, there were many parts that are difficult to understand when the result is only a word,
    because sometimes programm give correct sign (green sign) but result was wrong.
    However, since kivy has produced visual results, it has become easier to pinpoint and fix errors.
    It was not only an error, but it was able to make a lot of experiment in comfort,
    because it was able to see it visually immediately after modifying it in the design stage little by little.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
    There are too many assignments for me right now. In particular, there were too many assignments with similar deadlines.
    So, before I started coding, I started coding without thinking exactly.
    There were more errors than I expected, and there was a lot of work to fix the finished code.
    However, when I found the code I practiced in practice class and found the code through Google,
    I found that the codes for each situation were similar and I could code it with a little more understanding.
    Next time, if I start with the correct idea before coding, I will be able to work much easier.


## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.

    I used the kivy-demos file which is provided in the practical class for working on this project.
    I also learned a lot of code through Google search.
    I mainly tried to find the kivy related code in the demo file provided at practice class,
    (For instance, I learnt how to import StringProperty to mark status bars in the GUI. And additionally,
    how to make buttons and add them to the interface),
    and I used the Google search for the confusing part in creating main.


## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

    There has been a lot of trial and error when I was coding for this project.
    Strangely, there was not much difficulty in creating kivy, book, and bookList.
    However, the biggest difficulty was making the main function we've been doing so far.
    I feel that every time when I doing an assignment, after finishing the assignment,
    I understand all the code and think why I had trouble in coding it.
    Again, I had a lot of trouble creating the main function.
    I cannot explain how I overcame it, but I think I have overcome my difficulties naturally
    by investing a lot of time and effort for trying to understand it.
